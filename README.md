### React version of Windows game.

Once upon a time being on an internship I wrote Minesweeper in vanilla JS. I recently took a look at this code and thought it would be cool to refresh it while learning the basics of React.

A major refresh of the interface is planned, as well as the next point of exploring new technologies - TypeScript.
